<div class='story'><h2>MC Masala, a column by Sumana Harihareswara</h2>
<p>This is the archive of my newspaper column.
</p>
<p>Between April 2005 and August 2007, I <a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2011/02/23/0">wrote a weekly column</a> called "MC Masala" for the "Inside Bay Area" section of several papers in the San Francisco Bay Area, including the Oakland Tribune. My work circulated to about a million people, I'm told. You can now read these stories below.</p>
<p>(I'm a better writer now but some of the columns still stand up okay.)</p>
<p>You can also see and reuse <a href="https://github.com/brainwane/mcmasala">the code I wrote to make this site</a>.</p>
